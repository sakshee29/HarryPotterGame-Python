# PythonTokenGame


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

This is a self-progressing game in python which draws 4 different types of tokens randomly in a 6*6 matrix. The player who gets at least 4 tokens in the top row of each column wins and gets a gold star. If no player gets majority tokens in the top row, then it's a draw and each player gets a silver star.
Everytime the function runs, a different dataset is generated thus, tokens are placed randomly.

**Code provided my univeristy**: Turtle code for the matrix and randomly generated dataset.

**My Goal**
1. Drawing 4 different Tokens using turtle graphics.
2. Interpreting the dataset to exactly place the tokens in the current position. 
3. Algorithm to perform the winning logic.
